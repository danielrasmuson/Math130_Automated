Math 130 Automated Grading
==============

Just a readme so we can communicate about stuffs.

C:\Users\Daniel\Documents\GitHub\Math130_Automated\gui.py:
  122              name = self.lab_tree_list.GetItemText(item)
  123              section = self.assignmentStack[name].getSection()
  124:             # # @TODO get tech id
  125              self.UpdateStudentInformation(name, section, "Unknown")
  126              if self.initialized:

I'm thinking of starting export CSV grades 
  heres I'm thinking it might look.
  1. Button that pushes student results to CSV
  2. After this button is pressed it puts a green check next to student name
  3. You have to press this button to confirm the grading on each students report

@TODO - Current send to grade won't overlap already pushed grade  

Possible ideas for future
-------------------------
redo document importing (faster with equations) - Greg
    noticing when document has and does not have equations
    speed up word document opening
update assignment class with getAnswer() etc
Run results vs attendance quiz
inner classes - re structure code
wizard for loading files
disable buttons when you cant use them - Greg
add checkmark to done students - Greg
    look into wrapper for trees
ability to add more answers ($10.40 | 10 dollar 40 cents) - Dan
Add multiple lines to student quesitons
grading support for multiple sections
ability to move students from incorrect or missing section


Done
-----------------------------
change value of question right changes value of score
file name support
update question bank for getAnswer(qNum)
