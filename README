Math 130 Automated Grading
==============

Just a readme so we can communicate about stuffs.

C:\Users\Daniel\Documents\GitHub\Math130_Automated\gui.py:
  122              name = self.lab_tree_list.GetItemText(item)
  123              section = self.assignmentStack[name].getSection()
  124:             # # @TODO get tech id
  125              self.UpdateStudentInformation(name, section, "Unknown")
  126              if self.initialized:

I'm thinking of starting export CSV grades 
  heres I'm thinking it might look.
  1. Button that pushes student results to CSV
  2. After this button is pressed it puts a green check next to student name
  3. You have to press this button to confirm the grading on each students report

@TODO - Current send to grade won't overlap already pushed grade
