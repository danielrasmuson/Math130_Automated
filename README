Math 130 Automated Grading
==============

Just a readme so we can communicate about stuffs.

C:\Users\Daniel\Documents\GitHub\Math130_Automated\gui.py:
  122              name = self.lab_tree_list.GetItemText(item)
  123              section = self.assignmentStack[name].getSection()
  124:             # # @TODO get tech id
  125              self.UpdateStudentInformation(name, section, "Unknown")
  126              if self.initialized:

I'm thinking of starting export CSV grades 
  heres I'm thinking it might look.
  1. Button that pushes student results to CSV
  2. After this button is pressed it puts a green check next to student name
  3. You have to press this button to confirm the grading on each students report

@TODO - Current send to grade won't overlap already pushed grade  

Possible ideas for future
-------------------------
1. disable buttons when you cant use them
2. grading support for multiple sections
3. wizard for loading files
4. noticing when document has and does not have equations
5. change value of question right changes value of score
6. ability to move students from incorrect or missing section
7. speed up word document opening
8. ability to add more answers ($10.40 | 10 dollar 40 cents)
9. add checkmark to done students
10. Add multiple lines to student quesitons
